Scripts used to carry out the simulation study published in Mallo D, Siavash M, Warnow T and Posada D 2017. Performance of species tree methods in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting.
These scripts have been adapted to our computational environment and will require some modifications to run in your system (at least the variable H and required modules).

Moreover, it requires the following software installed in your system:
RAxML 8.0
mrpmatrix https://github.com/smirarab/mrpmatrix
